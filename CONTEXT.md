# LexiQuest CMS

This project is an internal dashboard for a language learning app called LexiQuest. Basically, there's a language switcher, and when you pick a language, you can see all kinds of information about it.

The main features for each language are:
- Words
- Characters
- Stories

We use pnpm, @tanstack/react-query, shadcn/ui.
